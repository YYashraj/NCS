Notably, Ahmedabad Junction's inclusion emphasises its status as a vital nexus in Western India's economic landscape. Chennai Central, too, emerges as a significant gateway to the southern region, cementing its importance in fostering regional connectivity. Further amplifying the network's breadth, stations like H. Nizamuddin in Delhi and Secunderabad Junction in Hyderabad emerge as crucial links, seamlessly connecting diverse regions. Similarly, Yesvantpur Junction's presence highlights Bangalore's pivotal role in the South's transportation network."

The New Delhi station's reach is more spread out; it is not focused on any region.\n",

On the other hand, Chennai Central and Yesvantpur Junction (Bangalore) have many rail routes extending to different corners of the country. This cements these centers as important hubs of our economy.\n",

    "Come to think of reasons for the later, it could be due to the connected component being present in some region slightly cut off or inaccessible from the main subnetwork. For some places like a high plateau or a mountain range it would be hard to set up rails to them, but there could be intra-region railways there (like toy trains we have heard of). And other possible reason is that for some sparsely populated areas there won't be good cost-outcome tradeoff for setting railway connections to some more populated centres. In this areas other means of travel like bus would have been found to be more economical, hence they were probably cut-off from the main subnetwork. But there could be some up-down shift between such cities (like Jamner and Panchora), and thus a train must commute between them for easy travel for the residents of the city."
